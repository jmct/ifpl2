\maketitle


This is an updated version of SPJ's ``The Implementation of Functional
Programming Languages'' \citep{peyton1987implementation}. The goal is to update
the material with some of the great advances in research over the last 30
years.

One thing we will talk about is the \index{$G$-Machine} (which should be indexed).
